This software drives up to 16 daisy-chained TLC5940-based circuits each driving up to 40 RGB LEDs to create computer-controlled light shows.  Extends the basic TLC Arduino driver by Alex Leone.  Allows for control of an LED matrix using a standard language of serial commands.  Current features include scrolling text, draw-on-matrix control, keyboard hotkeys and realtime music visualization.

The system is intended to be a simpler and less expensive alternative to other open source LED projects.  We built a 10' x 7' light wall with 375 full color LEDs for less than $2,000.  The serial protocol abstracts away the need to understand the workings of the TLC chip and allows for simple programmatic control and animation of many hundreds of LEDs simultaneously.

The Magnificent Mood Machine was created with help from a generous grant by Transformus LLC.

The movie called Flicker is relevant to my interests.
